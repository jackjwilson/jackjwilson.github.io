I decided to start a blog for publishing “ideas in progress”. This website is being generated using jekyll, and, since I am not adept at this kind of thing, I decided to post a first blog as a way to practice and to say something about what this blog is for.

This blog is about the different strands of my thinking and to put some of my ideas down in print before I submit them as abstracts. In recent years I have had a few papers rejected from conferences and I think that part of the problem is that I often find myself at the interface of disciplines. Here I can say what I want. The hope is that writing it down will make it better.
My research focusses on the realtionship between linguistic pragmatics and gesture studies. I typically adopt a cognitive perspective on pragmatics
