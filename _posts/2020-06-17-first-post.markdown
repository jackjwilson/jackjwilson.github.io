<p>I decided to start a blog for publishing “ideas in progress”. This website is being generated using jekyll, and, since I am not adept at this kind of thing, I decided to post a first blog as a way to practice and to say something about what this blog is for.</p>
<p>This blog is about the different strands of my thinking and to put some of my ideas down in print before I submit them as abstracts. In recent years I have had a few papers rejected from conferences and I think that part of the problem is that I often find myself at the interface of disciplines. Here I can say what I want. The hope is that writing it down will make it better.</p>
<p>My research focusses on the realtionship between linguistic pragmatics and gesture studies. I typically adopt a cognitive perspective on pragmatics {% cite bara2010cognitive %}
