I am a Lecturer in Linguistics at the University of Salford. My research attempts to address the following question: 

__What is meaning in language and how does it differ from meaning we find elsewhere?__ 

This question has taken me in several different directions.

Some of my research focusses on co-speech gestures, which are meaningful gestures that accompany language use. In addressing this question, I adopt a variety of experimental and observational methods. I am particularly interested in whether or not gestures are produced with the intention to communicate.

I am working with [Prof Janet Watson](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/languages/staff/151/janet-c-e-watson) on the gesture used by speakers of endangered Modern South Arabian Languages. This research explores the relationship between language, gesture, cognition and culture. 

I am also a member of [the Salford Institute for dementia](https://www.salford.ac.uk/salford-institute-for-dementia) and work on projects exploring the relationship between language and dementia. At the moment I am working with [Six Degrees](http://six-degrees.org.uk/) and [Innovations in Dementia](http://www.innovationsindementia.org.uk/). 

Other recent research projects have explored the relatinoship between gesture and body position, (rural) Sign Languages, the evolution of sign systems, metaphor in contemporary song lyrics.
