I"È<p>I am a lecturer in linguistics at the University of Salford. My research attempts to address the following question:</p>

<p><strong>What is meaning in language and how does it differ from meaning we find elsewhere?</strong></p>

<p>This question has taken me in several different directions.</p>

<p>Some of my research focusses on co-speech gestures, which are meaningful gestures that accompany language use. In addressing this question, I adopt a variety of experimental and observational methods. I am particularly interested in whether or not gestures are produced with the intention to communicate.</p>

<p>I am working with <a href="https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/languages/staff/151/janet-c-e-watson">Prof Janet Watson</a> on the gesture used by speakers of endangered Modern South Arabian Languages. This research explores the relationship between language, gesture, cognition and culture.</p>

<p>I also a member of <a href="https://www.salford.ac.uk/salford-institute-for-dementia">the Salford Institute for dementia</a> and work on projects exploring the relationship between language and dementia. At the moment I am working with <a href="http://six-degrees.org.uk/">Six Degrees</a> and <a href="http://www.innovationsindementia.org.uk/">Innovations in Dementia</a>.</p>

<p>Other recent research projects have explored the relatinoship between gesture and body position, (rural) Sign Languages, the evolution of sign systems, metaphor in contemporary song lyrics.</p>
