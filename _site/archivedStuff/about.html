					<div class="about-content">
					<p>I am a lecturer in linguistics at the University of Salford. My research attempts to address the following question: What is meaning in language and how does it differ from meaning we find elsewhere? This question has taken me in several different directions</p>
					<p>Some of my research focusses on co-speech gestures, which are meaningful gestures that accompany language use. In addressing this question, I adopt a variety of experimental and observational methods. I am particularly interested in whether or not gestures are produced with the intention to communicate.</p>
					<p>I am working with Prof Janet Watson on the gesture used by speakers of endangered Modern South Arabian Languages. This research explores the relationship between language, gesture, cognition and culture.</p> 
					<p>I also a member of the Salford Institute for dementia and work on projects exploring the relationship between language and dementia. At the moment I am working with Six Degrees and Innovations in Dementia.</p> 
					<p>Other recent research projects have explored the relatinoship between gesture and body position, (rural) Sign Languages, the evolution of sign systems, metaphor in contemporary song lyrics.</p>
